The CPP child‑rearing provision (operational through Service Canada/ESDC) excludes low‑earnings years while caring for children under age 7 from the CPP contributory period, boosting retirement entitlements for primary caregivers (disproportionately women). Federal tax rules allowing pension income‑splitting between spouses help raise after‑tax income for lower‑income pensioners. Provincial/territorial family‑law frameworks require valuation/division of pension assets on separation/divorce, protecting accrued pension rights of spouses with interrupted workforce attachment. In addition, the 2019 CPP enhancement increases future accruals for all contributors. Quebec’s QPP implements analogous child‑rearing provisions. These instruments were operational as of 1 September 2024. If no single targeted “women’s pension” scheme exists, these measures function collectively to raise women’s pension benefits.",0.9,35.33,b2c14880-6da2-4827-81ea-62e8a652bad4,Correct,The A0 answer correctly identifies operative instruments as of 1 Sept 2024: the CPP child‑rearing provision (Service Canada) and Quebec QPP analogue; federal pension‑income splitting under the Income Tax Act/CRA; provincial/territorial pension‑division regimes on relationship breakdown; and the 2019 CPP enhancement.

Although procurement is governed by the Financial Administration Act and implemented through Treasury Board contracting policy and Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) rules, oversight is fragmented across departments and jurisdictions (federal/provincial/municipal), leading to inconsistent application and enforcement. Discretionary carve-outs and non‑competitive authorities, decentralized contracting practices, limited transparency for low‑value or negotiated procurements, capacity/resource constraints at oversight bodies, and slow/limited complaint remedies (administrative rather than criminal) reduce effective enforcement. These structural and resourcing issues also make it difficult to enforce policy objectives embedded in procurement rules (e.g., supplier diversity, social/equality aims).
